# Research_Project

The code for all models employed in this research project is reported in this repository.

In the dataset.ipynb file, we check the class-by-class splits and output 1 image per class label.

Inside the DINO and MSN folders, the whole models can be found, alongside their respective training and evaluation code that was used to output the graphs in the report (we also attached the respective licenses used for the original models).

DINO_Model.ipynb/MSN_Model.ipynb: Use this file to amend all the original model's architectures and parameters by using the magic cells provided. After running all the code, the .py files can be downloaded to be run on the university's HPC services.
